# Velocloud-API-PHP

Velocloud-API-PHP is a PHP binding for the Velocloud orchestrator REST API.

The code has been autogenerated using Swagger Codegen - https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen. 
A couple of minor changes have been made and the repo will aim to iron out any other issues that crop up.

The test.php script shows an example of logging in as an Enterprise user, and pulling a list of the connected Velocloud Edges.

The /doc directory contains the Swagger API documentation.
